Group study code: https://repl.it/@ChristianMorra/ZetaEtaDelta#main.py

Working as a group practicing Vocarrum Python Lab 3:
Build-in functions: print(), count()
Defining dictionaries 
Dictionary is a type oWhile f variable
While loop with an argument and conditional to calculate the charge
Dictionaries are comprised of an immutable key associated to its value. Keys must be immutable data types. (Ivan posted)
Dictionaries can be nested inside of each other.
To create an empty dictionary, use a pair of braces with nothing inside: {}
Keys are separated from their values by a colon: {"Key":"Value"}
Retrieve value in the dictionary by its key: myDict.get("key") or myD




Now are now moving the files from Repl to a Github repo:
Created a py file by c+p the contents of the file
Created, add the new repo to Github
Commit and then push the file to Github to the correct repo

We are not going over  Vocarrum Python Lab 4:
Learning to navigate through Repl a little.
Calling a function
Parameter in a function grabs the variable it is calling
The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function. ... A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

Built-in function return: asks what are we getting
A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned. Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-return-statement/
Use three quotes and \ to use multiple lines
Style limitation of 79 for a string for appearance and above wrap-arounds
We have created a functions but have not “called anything out”


Functions are normally long but for this lab it is small for understanding how a variable works
Testing out a function: printMany(x):
x is the parameter
Range is the function
The for-loop will continue till it reaches the input
X is a mutable variable 





Example of using a for-loop and a while-loop producing the same result:


Functions are important to make the code easier to read. 
Import function is used bring a package to your program
Method “just runs a block of code”,“methods are like verbs” - Christian
Methods and objects: Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

What is a Cesar Cipher: It shifts the letter in an amount spaces

Berul Ambatchew shared: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher 


We are now writing the algorithm for the Caesar Cipher
Explanation of how to cipher:

Looking at each line of code to see if we have any mistakes



Local variable example of running fish which equals 5:
Function has not argument
Fish variable is created within the local scope of the function, which means it can only be used in this function and not the global scope of the code
We are returning, or grabbing, the fish variable which was created within the function which means it is a local variable

Running the script to see what it looks like:
encryptedMessage and uppercaseMessage declares
Build-in functions list: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html 
 for currentCharacter in uppercaseMessage 
Position will find the location of the currentCharacter
newPosition will shift the letter over
If the user puts in an invaild letter, it will be untouched: if currentCharacter in alphabet conditional 


Running the function for this test produces the following:



VIsual of how a for-loop works with: hello world:
Location of the index in the array is important for how it prints. 
The ‘h’ is x [0], ‘e’ is x[1], etc. 


Shifting the index in the amount of the cipher key, with an example:


Reason we have a double alphabet is for when the shift occurs there will still be a letter to produce the outcome:
We are trying to access an index


We are not moving files over to Github.
https://github.com/ibacai/mega_team_repo



Move multiples files:


Crashed:


Worked:


Create Github:


Git push -f origin master


The push was successful:

Change Github to add collaborators :
